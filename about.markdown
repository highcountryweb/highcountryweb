High Country Web is a tiny tech studio run by Rohan Latimer who spent over 10 years freelancing in Melbourne, Victoria. The call of the mountains was too great and he left the bright lights of the city to focus, learn life skills and do what makes him happy. The studio grows and shrinks with each project so please be patient, and do what we do in the country - relax. [hcweb.io](https://hcweb.io/)
